# stanCode_Project

Hello everyone,    

I'm excited to welcome you to my repository, where I have compiled all the assignments I completed during the stanCode SC101 course in Taiwan. This collection represents a comprehensive exploration of fundamental Python concepts, ranging from image processing and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to data structures and recursion.    

Each assignment in this repository illustrates a different aspect of Python, showcasing its versatility and my growth in understanding its various applications. Whether you're interested in the intricacies of manipulating images, the principles of OOP, the complexities of different data structures, or the elegance of recursive algorithms, you'll find examples of each within this collection.   

My journey through the stanCode SC101 course has been both challenging and rewarding, and I hope that by sharing these assignments, I can provide you with insights and inspiration. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work and for being a part of my learning journey in Python!
